## Impact (required)

### User impact — pick **exactly one**

| Label | Use when |
|:--|:--|
| `user-impact-high` | Listeners clearly notice (player, search, downloads, onboarding, major UX) |
| `user-impact-medium` | Noticeable but not headline (polish, secondary flows) |
| `user-impact-low` | Minor user-facing tweak |
| `no-user-impact` | CI, docs, tooling, internal-only — no listener-facing change |

- [ ] `user-impact-high`
- [ ] `user-impact-medium`
- [ ] `user-impact-low`
- [ ] `no-user-impact`

### Listener impact — **required when** `user-impact-high` or `user-impact-medium`

<!-- Write this for a listener, not an engineer. What is different in their day-to-day use of boxlore after this ships? -->
<!-- Skip only for `user-impact-low` or `no-user-impact`. -->

**What changes in the user’s life:**

-

### Backend — optional, **pairable** with any user-impact level

| Label | Use when |
|:--|:--|
| `backend-change` | Touches server / proxy / infra (can combine with high/medium/low/none) |

- [ ] `backend-change`

Examples: `user-impact-high` + `backend-change`, or `no-user-impact` + `backend-change`, or just `user-impact-medium`.

Add the labels on the PR (`gh pr edit <n> --add-label user-impact-high --add-label backend-change`).
